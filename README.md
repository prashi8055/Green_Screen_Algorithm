- Chroma key compositing, or chroma keying, is a visual-effects and post-production technique for compositing (layering) two images or video streams together based on colour hues (chroma range).
- The technique has been used in many fields to remove a background from the subject of a photo or video â€“ particularly the newscasting, motion picture, and video game industries.
- A colour range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene.
- This technique is also referred to as colour keying, colour-separation overlay, or by various terms for specific colour-related variants such as green screen,
  blue screen and magic pink; chroma keying can be done with backgrounds of any colour that are uniform and distinct, but green and blue backgrounds are more commonly used 
  because they differ most distinctly in hue from human skin colours. 
- No part of the subject being filmed or photographed may duplicate the colour used as the backing, otherwise, the part may be erroneously identified as part of the backing.
